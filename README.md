# RandomAdditions
A bunch of neat additions for block modders to use.
Also comes with some quality-of-life changes like: 
+ Fabricator item return 
+ Extended Photo Camera range

 Shield damageable type fixing optional in TTMM, splitting off into a sepearate mod later on TTSMM.


See BlockModulesJSONExamples.txt for block module documentation and
NewProjectilesJSONExamples.txt for projectile module documentation.

Some new modules may be unstable, so be sure to test them in action before releasing your blocks with them.
